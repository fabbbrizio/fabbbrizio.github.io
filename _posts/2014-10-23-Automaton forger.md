Personal research and graphic sperimentation between hand-drawing and automate-drawing.

This short research is led by a personal investigation on the transition of the practice of analog and digital drawing, in the eld of illustration and Design. Digital media – such as graphic design software – offer enormous technical and professional opportunities, but also open many questions with regard to the changes that will respect the mental processes, approaches, processes, and stylistic choices.

Each technical tool is also a cognitive tool, designed to respond to a speci c need, to be an extension of human capabilities.
My research is organized into three parts.

In the first part I have outlined how drawing is a common practice in various disciplines which study and operate in the fields of visual communication, and that recurs in different stages of their design process. Through the use of metaphors, drawing is used to represent and communicate in a fast and coordinated way the thought, turning abstract concepts into structures of visual signs, filtering them and turning them into understandable and shareable visual languages. A sort of historical investigation focused on the relationships between people and tools, and the cognitive aspects in between.

Subsequently, the research moves to the changes brought by technological development and mass diffusion of digital technologies and interfaces in the fields of design. Other implicit issues in this discourse are relating to the concepts of originality and autorship of the physical-virtual artefacts.

My work concerns reflections on contemporary media and the connections between procedures and technical tools. It is an observation on different media, analog and digital,
and union between different systems, thinking in a different way the linearity of technological progress, analog > digital.

This set of procedures will be carried out through the use of various means which exponentially reduce the coordination brain–hand–sign, up to the limit case – the automated drawing through drawbot – with the aim of thinking processes on the basis of the relationship between author, technical tool and representation.

In a speech about the means and processes related to visual communication, disciplinary boundaries appear to be mere preconception. Therefore it is necessary to develop an awareness on the design tools and collaboration, between people from different fields – such as illustration and design

Some applications of the experiment had the potential aim to not reveal explicitly the gap between the analog and the digital process of the drawings.
