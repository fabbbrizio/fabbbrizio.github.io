Motion graphic for a theatrical reading event, Puglia - Italy.

This anthology is the end product of a collective writing workshop project promoted by the association Re:Common and run by Wu Ming 2 between January and June 2014.

These are groups (actively part of movements) committed to opposing some of the GODII (Devastating and Senseless Mega Projects) that are currently destroying, impoverishing and abusing Italy’s land and democracy.

GODIImenti is also a concert reading, combining readings with music, staged by Wu Ming 2 and Egle Sommacal (from the band Massimo Volume).
