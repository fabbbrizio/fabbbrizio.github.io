Audiovisual interactive installation in an abandoned theatre.

The theatre, built in an hospital for children – Ospedale al Mare – in 1926, is situated in front of the sea in Lido of Venice area. The theatre was exemplar for art-therapy, it advanced a synthesis between health and the performance arts.

The installation is been thought in this place because is very evocative and attractive, besides being a beautiful theatre was also a special place in which the patients could practice heliotherapy and took advantage from the benefits of sun exposure.

The installation aimed to resurrect in a fragmentary and meditative way it creates an immersive experience for people that – through <b>sights</b> and <b>sounds</b> – introduces them to the history of the theatre and its lived past.

I worked on concept, prototyping experimentation, visual design of the archives photos; I researched and developed the connection between sound and photos by programming with Processing.
