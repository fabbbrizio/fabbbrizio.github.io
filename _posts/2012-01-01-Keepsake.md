Audiovisual interactive installation in an abandoned theatre.

The theatre, built in an hospital for children – Ospedale al Mare – in 1926, is situated in front of the sea in Lido of Venice area. The theatre was exemplar for art-therapy, it advanced a synthesis between health and the performance arts.

The installation is been thought in this place because is very evocative and attractive, besides being a beautiful theatre was also a special place in which the patients could practice heliotherapy and took advantage from the benefits of sun exposure.

The installation aimed to resurrect in a fragmentary and meditative way it creates an immersive experience for people that – through <b>sights</b> and <b>sounds</b> – introduces them to the history of the theatre and its lived past.

I worked on concept, prototyping experimentation, visual design of the archives photos; I researched and developed the connection between sound and photos by programming with Processing.

The project was made with Claudia Miliziano, Fabio Nucatolo and Rita Petrilli in the Interaction Design Lab at Iuav University of Venice.
