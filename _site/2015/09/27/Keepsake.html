<p>&lt;!–</p>

<p>Audiovisual interactive installation in an abandoned theatre.</p>

<p>The building, built in the 30’s in an hospital for children, is in front of the sea on Venice area.
The installation aims to resurrect, in a fragmentary and meditative way, the sights and sounds of this places. Keepsake allows people to live a melancholic experience that, through sound and images, introduces them to the history of the theatre and its lived past.
