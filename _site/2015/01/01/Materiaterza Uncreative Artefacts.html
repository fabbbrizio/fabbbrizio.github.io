Materiaterza is a Design Collective Project aimed to research on design methodologies and production processes.</p>

<p>The origin of the project came from the encounter between Davide Tuberga – product designer – and Andrea Reggiani – artisan ceramist – who develop a new method to extruding ceramic material, building a unique 3D printer.</p>

<p>I joined the group with Chiara Costantini – graphic designer – with the interest to explore deeply this kind of production processes, that fuse the traditional handicraft with modern digital approaches.</p>

<p>Materiaterza graphic identity follow a generative design process. As for the three coordinates values X, Y, Z of the 3D printer movement – necessary to permit to extrude every material artefact – a similar process is implemented in the typography variations procedure of the logo. I decided to use as picture element of the logo the first letter, <i>M</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way as using the 3D printer software is possible change just some variables to create very different concave objects, I research new shapes for the M moving the type on X, Y axes, rotating and extruding it on Z axis. Then using a full-black color, I give a bidimensional perception to the altered version of the M.</p>

<p>In the end I create a pattern that imitates the ceramic extruded form, and I used it in different context (printed communication artifacts, graphic on the web).</p>

<p>For the project I designed the identity for printed artefacts and shops exposition of the ceramic 3D printed objects, and I developed <a href="http://materiaterza.com/" target="_blank">Materiaterza website</a> (Online only presentation page at the moment).</p>
