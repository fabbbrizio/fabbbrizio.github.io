  Hello, I am Fabrizio, interaction designer and random illustrator.
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I work across different communication disciplines; from identity, user experience and interface design, illustration for digital and print.
  &nbsp;&nbsp; As designer I had the pleasure to work in team with independent design collective, as <a href="http://www.iperstudio.net/" target="_blank">Iperstudio</a> and digital agencies.
  I collaborated as researcher and designer with a program of <a href=" https://www.unops.org/english/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank"> United Nations Office for Project Services </a> and other organizations.
  I studied at IUAV, University of Venice, attending the <a href="http://www.interaction-venice.com/" target="_blank">IxD program</a> run by Gillian Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor.
